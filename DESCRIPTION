Description: Reproducible and remixable species distribution modelling.
    The package reads user submitted modules from an online repository, runs
    full species distribution modelling workflows and returns output that is
    fully reproducible. For examples and detailed discussion refer to: N.Golding
    et al. (2017) 'The zoon r package for reproducible and shareable species
    distribution modelling'. Methods in Ecology and Evolution.
